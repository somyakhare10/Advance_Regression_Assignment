## General Information
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The data is provided in the CSV file below.

The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

You are required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1 Data Understanding/ExplorationÂ¶ In this section, we have analysed the given dataset w.r.to it's structure. In the process, we have changed the data types of few columns and also changed some of the values based on Data Dictionary.
- Conclusion 2 Data Visualization: In this section, we have looked at the actual data content.We plotted few distribution plots and a correleation Matrix and heatmap for numerical varibales.
- Data Preparation: The main task done in this section are: create the respective dummy variables delete the irrelevant data.
  also replaced values which shows as NA to NAN.
- Conclusion 4 Model Building and Evaluation: In this section, we build our first model considering all the variables and then we made an informed choice based on VIF and p-values and finally made our baseline model with 7 variables. We also plotted the error term to check if they are normally distributed. Our regression line also looks pretty clustered around the central line.
